I am a gravitational wave astrophysicist, and my research lies at the boundary between simulation and observation. I'm paticularly interested in how we can use machine learning to improve and accelerate theoretical models of the the gravitational signals from mergers of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars), and how we use those models to infer astrophysical information about the black holes and neutron stars that made them. 

I'm currently a [Postdoctoral Research Scholar Associate](https://www.pma.caltech.edu/people/lucy-thomas) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working in both the Theoretical Astrophysics Including Relativity (TAPIR) group and the LIGO Laboratory.

When I'm not doing science, I like to cook (especially baking), I love to sing, paint and travel.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
